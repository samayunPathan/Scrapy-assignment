A Conpulsory charge of tips, don’t be fool by the name, it is non-discussionary) AFTER CHECKING OUT of the hotel.  I was being charged with a discussionary charge of the tips on the credit card  automatically without being informed upfront after I checked out and left the hotel. 
When I checked out, i was informed at the counter that they were closing their account for previous day and they would help me check out my room and email me the invoice of my stay after they finished closing account. As a result, I innocently left the hotel since I thought a 5-star hotel would not have anything gone wrong. However, I was totally wrong until I saw extra charges on my credit card while not receiving any so called invoice from the hotel at all. I then reached out to Trip.com to request for the invoice that they have promised to send to me and it was then I was informed that the extra charges were from a discussionary charge of tips. I wasn’t happy about the way this was done hence I requested for a refund for this since it clearly stated this is a DISCUSSIONARY fee, not a compulsory fee. However, I was informed that this is a Non-refundable fee and my request was denied.

Out of so many hotels I have stayed, it is unbelievable that in a 5-Star hotel, I was forced to pay something that wasn’t even being informed upfront. In addition, with the fee name suggested, it is a discussionary charge of tips NOT a compulsory charge of tips, the hotel has forced the customers to pay it as COMPULSORY CHARGE OF TIPS.

In addition, the hotel services were very inefficient and lot of rooms for improve. We ordered for an in-room meal and we were told that it would take about half an hour to deliver. Hence we waited, and until an hour later, there was no update on our meal and we had to make a call again to check for the progress of our meal. It was then we knew there was a delay in the meal. By the time we done with our meal, we made the call again to request for someone to collect the plates, we literally waited for more than an hour and had to call twice before someone came to pick up the plates.

This shouldn’t have been the service received in a 5-star hotel and the worst of all, the hotel should have more transparency in their charges and should have informed the customers on the charges upfront before the actual charging. When we signed for the amount paid for the meal, there were no statement on the discussionary charge of tips at all, and we didn’t expect there would be as we were not even informed. 
It is not that we are unwilling to give the tips and we did give the tips during the stay. However, it made us very uncomfortable that we weren’t informed anything upfront and it was charged to my credit card AFTER we CHECKED OUT of THE HOTEL. It made us feeling very unsafe to provide the credit card to the hotel as they can charge whatever charges they want after checking out the hotel. In addition, it is a discussionary charge, isn’t it should be discussed before I was being charged? If not it should be called a a compulsory charge of tips.</span></div><div class="relative fs-14_18 c-#3264ff font-normal mt-4px w-fit z-2 block hover:underline">Show More</div></div><div class="m-t-auto"><div class="h-1px rd-1px bg-gradient-linear shape-[-90deg] bg-gradient-from-#FFFFFF bg-gradient-to-#DADCDE m-b-12px"></div><div class="flex flex-row w-100%"><div class="w-100px h-132px m-r-12px overflow-hidden"><a href="https://uk.trip.com/hotels/london-hotel-detail-717957/royal-lancaster-london/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="block relative z-2 h-100% w-100%"><img class="w-100% h-100% b-rd-4px object-cover hover:scale-110 transition-all duration-500" src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVQYV2NgYAAAAAMAAWgmWQ0AAAAASUVORK5CYII=?default=1" alt="Royal Lancaster London"/></a></div><div class="relative flex-1 flex flex-col w-232px"><a href="https://uk.trip.com/hotels/london-hotel-detail-717957/royal-lancaster-london/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="fs-16_22 font-bold color-#0f294d hover:underline hover:c-#3264ff line-clamp-2 relative z-2">Royal Lancaster London</a><div class="flex flex-row m-t-8px  mb-20px"><svg viewBox="0 0 32 32" class="w-14px h-18px fill-#8592a6 mr-6px shrink-0"><use xlink:href="#location_filled"></use></svg><div class="c-#455873 fs-14_18 font-normal line-clamp-2">Hotel near  <a href="/hotels/list?city=338" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="c-#3264ff cursor-pointer hover:underline z-2 relative">Westminster, London</a> </div></div><div class="text-end c-#0f294d fs-14_18 mt-auto"><span>Price per night from:</span><span class="font-bold"> GBP 352</span></div></div></div></div><div class="absolute left-0 right-0 top-0 bottom-0 "></div></div><div class="card w-376px m-r-16px b-rd-8px shadow-4_8-down flex flex-col hover:shadow-8_16-down hover:cursor-pointer bg-#ffffff p-16px h-100% relative"><div class="m-b-12px"><div class="flex flex-row fs-20_26 flex-items-center font-bold none"><div class="b-rd-tr-0px b-rd-b-16px b-rd-tl-16px bg-#1136a6 h-100% p-x-9px p-y-3px"><b class=" c-#fff">4.4</b><b class="c-#fff op-50">/5</b></div><div class="c-#1136a6 m-l-4px">Excellent</div></div><div class="mt-8px line-clamp-4"><span class="inline-flex from-[rgba(15, 41, 77, .4)]-500 justify-center items-center w-24px h-24px rd-50%  bg-#f5594a c-#ffffff fs-16_22 font-bold m-r-6px">G</span><span class="inline-flex c-#0f294d font-bold fs-16_22 m-r-7px">Guest User</span><span class="fs-16_22 c-#0f294d">Just leaving Holiday Inn Sutton and have had a truly wonderful stay. This hotel was used as a base for exploring London and surrounding areas and can&#x27;t recommend highly enough. Ok we&#x27;re not talking 5 star luxury, but if you&#x27;re looking for that common sense should tell you to book elsewhere. However if you&#x27;re looking for CLEAN (so important) and comfort with EXCELLENT staff then this will be for you!  Staff are honestly some of the best I&#x27;ve encountered (even in 5 star hotels) and I don&#x27;t say that lightly. Restaurant, front desk, housekeeping, health club all an absolute credit to the hotel and brand. Thank you. Nothing was to much trouble and you made our stay really great. It&#x27;s the morning and evening acknowledements and friendly vibe and all the little touches that really do go a long way.  We&#x27;ll be back and would highly recommend this hotel and if there&#x27;s a way to reward staff on duty 27th-29th August 2022 please do :)</span></div><div class="relative fs-14_18 c-#3264ff font-normal mt-4px w-fit z-2 block hover:underline">Show More</div></div><div class="m-t-auto"><div class="h-1px rd-1px bg-gradient-linear shape-[-90deg] bg-gradient-from-#FFFFFF bg-gradient-to-#DADCDE m-b-12px"></div><div class="flex flex-row w-100%"><div class="w-100px h-132px m-r-12px overflow-hidden"><a href="https://uk.trip.com/hotels/sutton-hotel-detail-2147416/holiday-inn-london-sutton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="block relative z-2 h-100% w-100%"><img class="w-100% h-100% b-rd-4px object-cover hover:scale-110 transition-all duration-500" src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVQYV2NgYAAAAAMAAWgmWQ0AAAAASUVORK5CYII=?default=1" alt="Holiday Inn London - Sutton"/></a></div><div class="relative flex-1 flex flex-col w-232px"><a href="https://uk.trip.com/hotels/sutton-hotel-detail-2147416/holiday-inn-london-sutton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="fs-16_22 font-bold color-#0f294d hover:underline hover:c-#3264ff line-clamp-2 relative z-2">Holiday Inn London - Sutton</a><div class="flex flex-row m-t-8px  mb-20px"><svg viewBox="0 0 32 32" class="w-14px h-18px fill-#8592a6 mr-6px shrink-0"><use xlink:href="#location_filled"></use></svg><div class="c-#455873 fs-14_18 font-normal line-clamp-2">Hotel near  <a href="/hotels/list?city=9101" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="c-#3264ff cursor-pointer hover:underline z-2 relative">Sutton</a> </div></div><div class="text-end c-#0f294d fs-14_18 mt-auto"><span>Price per night from:</span><span class="font-bold"> GBP 91</span></div></div></div></div><div class="absolute left-0 right-0 top-0 bottom-0 "></div></div><div class="card w-376px m-r-16px b-rd-8px shadow-4_8-down flex flex-col hover:shadow-8_16-down hover:cursor-pointer bg-#ffffff p-16px h-100% relative"><div class="m-b-12px"><div class="flex flex-row fs-20_26 flex-items-center font-bold none"><div class="b-rd-tr-0px b-rd-b-16px b-rd-tl-16px bg-#1136a6 h-100% p-x-9px p-y-3px"><b class=" c-#fff">4.4</b><b class="c-#fff op-50">/5</b></div><div class="c-#1136a6 m-l-4px">Excellent</div></div><div class="mt-8px line-clamp-4"><span class="inline-flex from-[rgba(15, 41, 77, .4)]-500 justify-center items-center w-24px h-24px rd-50%  bg-#ff6f00 c-#ffffff fs-16_22 font-bold m-r-6px">G</span><span class="inline-flex c-#0f294d font-bold fs-16_22 m-r-7px">Guest User</span><span class="fs-16_22 c-#0f294d">This is a beautiful old building that has been made a boutique hotel. We started in a ground floor room then we’re upgraded, at management’s initiative, to a third floor suite. Both rooms were wonderful. The staff were very helpful and the breakfast very nice. They have spa services, but we didn’t use it. The location is a quiet area and can be a bit confusing to find from Canary Wharf, but is not touristy at all. Overall a great place to stay.</span></div><div class="relative fs-14_18 c-#3264ff font-normal mt-4px w-fit z-2 block hover:underline">Show More</div></div><div class="m-t-auto"><div class="h-1px rd-1px bg-gradient-linear shape-[-90deg] bg-gradient-from-#FFFFFF bg-gradient-to-#DADCDE m-b-12px"></div><div class="flex flex-row w-100%"><div class="w-100px h-132px m-r-12px overflow-hidden"><a href="https://uk.trip.com/hotels/london-hotel-detail-7329019/lansbury-heritage-a-sunday-hotel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="block relative z-2 h-100% w-100%"><img class="w-100% h-100% b-rd-4px object-cover hover:scale-110 transition-all duration-500" src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVQYV2NgYAAAAAMAAWgmWQ0AAAAASUVORK5CYII=?default=1" alt="Lansbury Heritage A Sunday Hotel"/></a></div><div class="relative flex-1 flex flex-col w-232px"><a href="https://uk.trip.com/hotels/london-hotel-detail-7329019/lansbury-heritage-a-sunday-hotel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="fs-16_22 font-bold color-#0f294d hover:underline hover:c-#3264ff line-clamp-2 relative z-2">Lansbury Heritage A Sunday Hotel</a><div class="flex flex-row m-t-8px  mb-20px"><svg viewBox="0 0 32 32" class="w-14px h-18px fill-#8592a6 mr-6px shrink-0"><use xlink:href="#location_filled"></use></svg><div class="c-#455873 fs-14_18 font-normal line-clamp-2">Hotel near  <a href="/hotels/list?city=338" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="c-#3264ff cursor-pointer hover:underline z-2 relative">Tower Hamlets, London</a> </div></div><div class="text-end c-#0f294d fs-14_18 mt-auto"><span>Price per night from:</span><span class="font-bold"> GBP 97</span></div></div></div></div><div class="absolute left-0 right-0 top-0 bottom-0 "></div></div><div class="card w-376px m-r-16px b-rd-8px shadow-4_8-down flex flex-col hover:shadow-8_16-down hover:cursor-pointer bg-#ffffff p-16px h-100% relative"><div class="m-b-12px"><div class="flex flex-row fs-20_26 flex-items-center font-bold none"><div class="b-rd-tr-0px b-rd-b-16px b-rd-tl-16px bg-#1136a6 h-100% p-x-9px p-y-3px"><b class=" c-#fff">4.3</b><b class="c-#fff op-50">/5</b></div><div class="c-#1136a6 m-l-4px">Excellent</div></div><div class="mt-8px line-clamp-4"><span class="inline-flex from-[rgba(15, 41, 77, .4)]-500 justify-center items-center w-24px h-24px rd-50%  bg-#7378e6 c-#ffffff fs-16_22 font-bold m-r-6px">G</span><span class="inline-flex c-#0f294d font-bold fs-16_22 m-r-7px">Guest User</span><span class="fs-16_22 c-#0f294d">Our experience at this hotel  was just phenomenal! Tarek at the front desk deserves a raise! I communicated with him through the phone as we were arriving super early and his honesty of possibly having a room ready helped us Taylor the beginning of our trip. We were able to check in early with him and we received a following up call from Tarek 5mn after entering the room,  as he wanted to make sure we were happy with our room and that he was there if we needed him. Even during a very busy period he made the time to sort through all our requests. Such service makes the difference and that convinced us to come back in the future.   The views from the higher floors are amazing. The room was clean and the perfect size for our 5 night stay.  The bar/restaurant always had a great vibe both a breakfast and dinner; the serving sizes were large and we were very pleased. The lobby area is very well done and smells really nice!  Only little downside was there was no business center and we needed to print some stuff . However, Tarek offered immediately to print our documents.   We had such a fantastic stay and felt being taken care of throughout the whole stay, will surely be returning!</span></div><div class="relative fs-14_18 c-#3264ff font-normal mt-4px w-fit z-2 block hover:underline">Show More</div></div><div class="m-t-auto"><div class="h-1px rd-1px bg-gradient-linear shape-[-90deg] bg-gradient-from-#FFFFFF bg-gradient-to-#DADCDE m-b-12px"></div><div class="flex flex-row w-100%"><div class="w-100px h-132px m-r-12px overflow-hidden"><a href="https://uk.trip.com/hotels/london-hotel-detail-717994/the-chelsea-harbour-hotel-london/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="block relative z-2 h-100% w-100%"><img class="w-100% h-100% b-rd-4px object-cover hover:scale-110 transition-all duration-500" src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVQYV2NgYAAAAAMAAWgmWQ0AAAAASUVORK5CYII=?default=1" alt="The Chelsea Harbour Hotel and Spa"/></a></div><div class="relative flex-1 flex flex-col w-232px"><a href="https://uk.trip.com/hotels/london-hotel-detail-717994/the-chelsea-harbour-hotel-london/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="fs-16_22 font-bold color-#0f294d hover:underline hover:c-#3264ff line-clamp-2 relative z-2">The Chelsea Harbour Hotel and Spa</a><div class="flex flex-row m-t-8px  mb-20px"><svg viewBox="0 0 32 32" class="w-14px h-18px fill-#8592a6 mr-6px shrink-0"><use xlink:href="#location_filled"></use></svg><div class="c-#455873 fs-14_18 font-normal line-clamp-2">Hotel near  <a href="/hotels/list?city=338" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="c-#3264ff cursor-pointer hover:underline z-2 relative">Hammersmith and Fulham, London</a> </div></div><div class="text-end c-#0f294d fs-14_18 mt-auto"><span>Price per night from:</span><span class="font-bold"> GBP 179</span></div></div></div></div><div class="absolute left-0 right-0 top-0 bottom-0 "></div></div><div class="card w-376px m-r-16px b-rd-8px shadow-4_8-down flex flex-col hover:shadow-8_16-down hover:cursor-pointer bg-#ffffff p-16px h-100% relative"><div class="m-b-12px"><div class="flex flex-row fs-20_26 flex-items-center font-bold none"><div class="b-rd-tr-0px b-rd-b-16px b-rd-tl-16px bg-#1136a6 h-100% p-x-9px p-y-3px"><b class=" c-#fff">4.2</b><b class="c-#fff op-50">/5</b></div><div class="c-#1136a6 m-l-4px">Very Good</div></div><div class="mt-8px line-clamp-4"><span class="inline-flex from-[rgba(15, 41, 77, .4)]-500 justify-center items-center w-24px h-24px rd-50%  bg-#06aebd c-#ffffff fs-16_22 font-bold m-r-6px">G</span><span class="inline-flex c-#0f294d font-bold fs-16_22 m-r-7px">Guest User</span><span class="fs-16_22 c-#0f294d">This hotel is a clean modern hotel which is well maintained. My wife and I stayed here twice, for 3 and 4 days respectively while touring the UK. The rooms were comfortable for sleeping, quiet and the air-conditioning worked well. The bathrooms were well designed and very clean. Housekeeping was fine. The major problem was that both of our rooms were very small and they had virtually no space for clothing. There was no usable drawer space and closets were tiny and had an inadequate number of hangers as well. If you are traveling for other than 1-2 days, there is no place to put anything. Living out of suitcases for 4 days or more does not add to the enjoyment of one&#x27;s trip. The Breakfast is at best, just OK. There is a minimal amount of fresh fruit and while you can order off a hot  breakfast menu, most things we ordered were not very good, so we stopped doing that. The Reception staff was marginally helpful. No one came to help us with our luggage. If you need a taxi or limo to take you to the airport, you are on your own. In addition, the front of the hotel is covered by bus stops so the taxi or limo has to try to find a place to pull us to load or unload. There are just a lot of annoying things about this hotel, some could be remedied, others probably not. For my next visit to London, I will not be staying here.</span></div><div class="relative fs-14_18 c-#3264ff font-normal mt-4px w-fit z-2 block hover:underline">Show More</div></div><div class="m-t-auto"><div class="h-1px rd-1px bg-gradient-linear shape-[-90deg] bg-gradient-from-#FFFFFF bg-gradient-to-#DADCDE m-b-12px"></div><div class="flex flex-row w-100%"><div class="w-100px h-132px m-r-12px overflow-hidden"><a href="https://uk.trip.com/hotels/london-hotel-detail-2198959/dorsett-shepherds-bush-london/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="block relative z-2 h-100% w-100%"><img class="w-100% h-100% b-rd-4px object-cover hover:scale-110 transition-all duration-500" src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVQYV2NgYAAAAAMAAWgmWQ0AAAAASUVORK5CYII=?default=1" alt="Dorsett Shepherds Bush London"/></a></div><div class="relative flex-1 flex flex-col w-232px"><a href="https://uk.trip.com/hotels/london-hotel-detail-2198959/dorsett-shepherds-bush-london/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="fs-16_22 font-bold color-#0f294d hover:underline hover:c-#3264ff line-clamp-2 relative z-2">Dorsett Shepherds Bush London</a><div class="flex flex-row m-t-8px  mb-20px"><svg viewBox="0 0 32 32" class="w-14px h-18px fill-#8592a6 mr-6px shrink-0"><use xlink:href="#location_filled"></use></svg><div class="c-#455873 fs-14_18 font-normal line-clamp-2">Hotel near  <a href="/hotels/list?city=338" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class="c-#3264ff cursor-pointer hover:underline z-2 relative">Hammersmith and Fulham, London</a> </div></div><div class="text-end c-#0f294d fs-14_18 mt-auto"><span>Price per night from:</span><span class="font-bold"> GBP 134</span></div></div></div></div><div class="absolute left-0 right-0 top-0 bottom-0 "></div></div><div class="card w-376px m-r-16px b-rd-8px shadow-4_8-down flex flex-col hover:shadow-8_16-down hover:cursor-pointer bg-#ffffff p-16px h-100% relative"><div class="m-b-12px"><div class="flex flex-row fs-20_26 flex-items-center font-bold none"><div class="b-rd-tr-0px b-rd-b-16px b-rd-tl-16px bg-#1136a6 h-100% p-x-9px p-y-3px"><b class=" c-#fff">4.2</b><b class="c-#fff op-50">/5</b></div><div class="c-#1136a6 m-l-4px">Very Good</div></div><div class="mt-8px line-clamp-4"><span class="inline-flex from-[rgba(15, 41, 77, .4)]-500 justify-center items-center w-24px h-24px rd-50%  bg-#ffb400 c-#ffffff fs-16_22 font-bold m-r-6px">G</span><span class="inline-flex c-#0f294d font-bold fs-16_22 m-r-7px">Guest User</span><span class="fs-16_22 c-#0f294d">The room is small but comfortable.

Simple, classy, hub hotel room.   Amazing central London location. Steps away from tube station, we visited tourist sites in the area.  Great for our city weekend break.   The beds are superbly comfortable.  I travelled solo ALOT for work, so I know what I like or not about hotel rooms. On this occasion I was traveling with my 3 kids, and the absence of TV meant they slept undistracted. The absence of carpeted floors, decorative pillows and bed runners, (that I suspect are rarely washed in other hotels) was perfect, as it means I didn&#x27;t have to make sure my kids weren&#x27;t touching any unclean fabric items.  We were out for majority of our stay. So the lack of view/windows, wasn&#x27;t any concern. No breakfast option, but we grabbed fruit for breakfast from Tesco express nearby. There is a 24hour cafe &amp; bar next door, that is good option too.  If you know what you&#x27;re booking and what to expect, you won&#x27;t be claustrophobic, instead you&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised.  Reception team member is my reason for leaving a review though - he comp&#x27;d our left luggage :)  I hope if Zedwell family see this they compliment his action, because he&#x27;s gained you return custom and extra revenue, as I&#x27;ll now book again due to how thoughtful and personable his service was towards my family, thank you. I&#x27;ve misplaced where I noted his name, Sherif(?) [Tall, young, South Asian origin].

It only depends on the hardware and the maximum is 2,000 RMB per night. However, there seem to be so few hotel rooms in the same location and level in the UK. I don't understand how those European friends with big waists live. The hardware facilities are completely incomparable with hotels of the same level in the same location in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou.","rating":4.5,"avatarImgUrl":"https://ak-d.tripcdn.com/target/zc0e170000011go8z7956.jpg","reviewDate":"2023-07-12 23:53:22"},"stimulation":{"lastBookTime":{"value":0,"unit":"Hour"}},"encourage":{"breakfast":true,"cancellation":false},"displayPrice":{"price":525,"taxPrice":630,"oriPrice":0,"checkIn":"2024-08-12"},"hotelFeatureTagInfo":[],"openYear":"2010-01-01","fitmentYear":"2010-01-01"},{"hotelId":2382991,"hotelUrl":"sea-containers-london","hotelJumpUrl":"https://uk.trip.com/hotels/london-hotel-detail-2382991/sea-containers-london/","hotelMetaJumpUrl":"https://uk.trip.com/hotels/list/searchresults?city=338\u0026hotelid=2382991","hotelName":"Sea Containers London","districtName":"Southwark","districtId":685426,"districtJumpUrl":"/hotels/list?city=338\u0026optionType=Zone\u0026optionId=685426","hotelNameUrl":"/hotels/london-hotel-detail-2382991/sea-containers-london/","lat":51.50820170000001,"lon":-0.106863,"brief":"Located in London (London City Centre), Sea Containers London is within a 15-minute walk of Tate Modern and London Eye.

We were exhausted the night before after coming back to hotel late and after having shower just jumped straight into beds - who would have thought we weren’t they only ones spending night in those beds!  Quick research after our findings and we realised that those were BEDBUGS! Never in my life had I come across anything like this before, not even after being a student and staying at questionable hostels! We reported this to the reception and were offered another room. We didn’t move immediately in the morning and made an agreement that we would move in the evening when we would be back to the hotel. Coming back in the evening and reporting to the reception for a new room, we found one of the evening staff being rude to us and questioning if the bedbugs were from their hotel (like what?!?!?!?). Simple, we said, because we had photo and video evidence of bedbugs crawling all over the beds, we said! This quickly ended her argument with us.  We then moved to our new room, where there was no obvious evidence of bedbug infestation, however being a reportedly new room, we found hair all over the floor in the bathroom of that allegedly “cleaned” new room.  Unfortunately, being an extremely sensitive to cleanness person and following the events of the previous night, I decided to leave early and not spent another night in this disgusting hotel. My friend, who had a flight early next morning however had no chance and spend a little longer and left at 04am.  The evening I decided to leave I started coming out in rash, which had only been getting worse ever since. The intensity of the itch is like nothing I’d ever experienced before - it stops me from sleeping, it drives me absolutely mad, no matter how much I try, one can’t look professional when they have bite marks all over their body, including the face, ears, neck, fingers, hands, forearms - ie areas one can’t cover up - and needing to constantly scratch herself! This obviously has affected my work! And the itch is no better even 6 days later!! In fact, the bite marks are now swollen, causing swelling of my fingers, the scratch marks are now bleeding and I am the most irritated I’ve ever been! Let me emphasise, this is six days later and I genuinely don’t know how much longer I’m yet to suffer!  I have obviously filed a complaint and have been contacted by the hotel - they are “kindly” offering to compensate the cost of my medication (as I am now on antihistamines - which don’t work really, as I can’t take the stronger type due to its sedating effect, as I have to continue working and driving; as well as steroid cream) and the cost of my dry cleaning. HOWEVER, despite multiple email exchanges and telephone consultations, they are not planning to refund a 100% of our payment, the argument being ","rating":1,"avatarImgUrl":"","reviewDate":"2022-10-21 22:47:25"},"stimulation":{"lastBookTime":{"value":0,"unit":"Hour"}},"commentTags":["\"Good Location\""],"encourage":{"breakfast":true,"cancellation":false},"displayPrice":{"price":67,"taxPrice":80,"oriPrice":76,"checkIn":"2024-08-12"},"hotelFeatureTagInfo":[],"openYear":"1972-01-01","fitmentYear":"2021-01-01","poiUrl":"/hotels/list?city=338","zoneName":"Westminster, London","level":"star"},{"hotelId":5576754,"hotelUrl":"ibis-budget-london-hounslow","hotelJumpUrl":"https://uk.trip.com/hotels/hounslow-hotel-detail-5576754/ibis-budget-london-hounslow/","hotelMetaJumpUrl":"https://uk.trip.com/hotels/list/searchresults?city=338\u0026hotelid=5576754","hotelName":"ibis budget London Hounslow","districtId":0,"hotelNameUrl":"/hotels/list/searchresults?hotelid=5576754\u0026city=10287","lat":51.4672576,"lon":-0.3668171,"brief":"We offer 148 well-appointed rooms with all the space you need, and none of the frills you don't.

The room was small, but we only needed it to sleep and so it wasn’t a problem. The cleanliness of the room wasn’t good. The floor was so filthy, that we just threw our socks away because of how black they were. The mattress on the single bunk bed was absolutely disgusting. I have attached photos. The sheet was just a piece of material folded in half, and wasn’t tucked in or anything which is how we noticed the dirty mattress. It was late when we noticed it, so I sent photos and an email to reception, who immediately offered us breakfast free of charge. We declined the breakfast as we already had reservations elsewhere, and we saw that breakfast was very poor with little on offer. The manager then replied and refunded our stay and cleaned the room.

The location of this hotel is great, right next to the Stratford International Train station and the Stratford Tub station.  I flew in from the US so I arrived to the hotel around 11:30 AM.  They said my room was not ready and they “reminded me” the actual check in time would be 3:00 PM.  I understood since my arrival was early, I headed to the lobby for drinks and lunch.   I checked back with the front desk around 1:30 thinking maybe they called housekeeping to get to my room cleaned quicker but no, still not ready.   As I sat in the lobby I would see other customers arrive and get checked in, I found it strange their rooms were ready but not mine.  I patiently waited until 3:05 PM, went to the front desk to get my room key….. room still not ready.  I have now been sitting in the lobby for almost 4 hours and my room was still not ready.  I don’t think they ever called housekeeping to work on my room.  It was finally ready at 3:30 PM.   Not a good start to my stay, the front desk staff was not helpful, apologetic, or even caring at all.   Later (after I requested to speak to a manager) I did get a call to apologize and offer me some free food, I declined stating they need to better manage the cleaning and check in process.     Front desk staff on Sunday 10/2 not great at all.  But the lobby, bar, and restaurant staff really turned around my initial poor arrival.  I cannot say enough about how attentive the wait staff and bartenders were all week.  Remember I had to sit in the lobby almost 4 hours on my first day.  But each day after work I would come to the lobby/bar areas for drinks and dinner each night.  Each morning I had breakfast in the restaurant and it was great.  Again the service was amazing and the hostess delivered a great morning welcome.    Room was nice well appointed.  Coffee maker, safe, and small refrigerator.  Large flat screen TC and nice desk to work at.  I was in room 419 with a nice view.  Bathroom was nice and the shower was very nice as well, walk in.   I had an early flight out the 7th so I was worried about what sort of front desk staff would be helping me at 5:30 AM.  Well they young man that was attending the front desk was efficient, professional, and very friendly.  A nice end to my stay.","rating":4,"avatarImgUrl":"","reviewDate":"2022-10-19 23:34:38"},"stimulation":{"lastBookTime":{"value":0,"unit":"Hour"}},"commentTags":["Great stay!","Great location"],"encourage":{"breakfast":true,"cancellation":false},"displayPrice":{"price":122,"taxPrice":146,"oriPrice":143,"checkIn":"2024-08-12"},"hotelFeatureTagInfo":[],"openYear":"2019-01-01","fitmentYear":"1753-01-01","poiUrl":"/hotels/list?city=338\u0026optionType=Zone\u0026optionId=1299","level":"star"},{"hotelId":51751154,"hotelUrl":"tower-suites-by-blue-orchid","hotelJumpUrl":"https://uk.trip.com/hotels/london-hotel-detail-51751154/tower-suites-by-blue-orchid/","hotelMetaJumpUrl":"https://uk.trip.com/hotels/list/searchresults?city=338\u0026hotelid=51751154","hotelName":"Tower Suites by Blue Orchid","districtName":"City of London","districtId":706849,"districtJumpUrl":"/hotels/list?city=338\u0026optionType=Zone\u0026optionId=706849","hotelNameUrl":"/hotels/london-hotel-detail-51751154/tower-suites-by-blue-orchid/","lat":51.5104665,"lon":-0.0752839,"brief":"Located in London (London City Centre), Tower Suites by Blue Orchid is within a 10-minute walk of Tower of London and Tower Bridge.

We stayed in a Dilly Classic room which was perfectly fine, a good size, clean with strong Wifi. The shower was powerful and there was plenty of hot water.  I know some people on this site weren't impressed by the breakfast but I thought it was great. Obviously, the location is fabulous.  However, I didn't feel the room was up to five-star standard.  The coffee was instant and the milk small UHT cartons. There was no fridge or mini-bar (though we were in the 'cheapest' room so may be different elsewhere). The toiletries were cheap and basic (so bring your own), there was no plug by the bed to charge devices overnight and no Blu-tooth speaker which seems to be a given now in higher-end hotels. The style of the room itself was quite dated including the landline next to the toilet which I'm sure was incredibly cool in 1986 :)  Overall, if this was a three-or-four-star hotel I'd give it full marks, but as it's a five-star, (and more importantly charging five-star prices), it's lacking in some areas.  I believe the hotel is currently 'between owners' which makes sense, as I guess the current owners don't want to invest and are ticking along until the new ones take over. It's not dreadful by any means, but they charge a lot for what you get.","rating":3,"avatarImgUrl":"","reviewDate":"2022-10-24 19:28:33"},"stimulation":{"lastBookTime":{"value":0,"unit":"Hour"}},"commentTags":["Great location","Great stay!"],"encourage":{"breakfast":true,"cancellation":false},"displayPrice":{"price":218,"taxPrice":262,"oriPrice":0,"checkIn":"2024-08-12"},"hotelFeatureTagInfo":[],"openYear":"1909-01-01","fitmentYear":"1753-01-01","poiUrl":"/hotels/list?city=338\u0026optionType=Zone\u0026optionId=1235","level":"star"},{"hotelId":2366400,"hotelUrl":"london-marriott-hotel-canary-wharf","hotelJumpUrl":"https://uk.trip.com/hotels/london-hotel-detail-2366400/london-marriott-hotel-canary-wharf/","hotelMetaJumpUrl":"https://uk.trip.com/hotels/list/searchresults?city=338\u0026hotelid=2366400","hotelName":"London Marriott Hotel Canary Wharf","districtName":"Tower Hamlets","districtId":685430,"districtJumpUrl":"/hotels/list?city=338\u0026optionType=Zone\u0026optionId=685430","hotelNameUrl":"/hotels/london-hotel-detail-2366400/london-marriott-hotel-canary-wharf/","lat":51.5072752,"lon":-0.0209951,"brief":"Located in London (Canary Wharf), London Marriott Hotel Canary Wharf is within a 10-minute drive of ExCeL Exhibition Centre and Tower of London.

Fantastic room - Executive Lounge Room 614 - with a great view of Crossrail. Only downside on that was that you heard the DLR starting at about 7am on the Sunday morning. The receptionist, Sandra, was really friendly and helpful and staffing the bar in the evening were likewise very good. The executive lounge on the 7th floor had a good selection of soft drinks, but we weren’t around to try the hot appetisers or free wine \u0026 beer in the evening as we already had dinner plans in the West End.  Transportation wise, it’s a 2 min walk to the DLR, less then 5 to the new Elizabeth Line and only a few more to the Jubilee Line - perfectly positioned! Lots of restaurants and bars to choose from as well.  Breakfast was fantastic, particularly loved the donut wall! Quite a novelty! The cooked breakfast was delicious, with omelettes made to order - more food than you could handle!

I booked in and paid in advance then on the day, I checked in and offered my photo ID as I had done previously and it had been accepted before, however on this occasion I was refused check-in as they had now decided only a passport would be acceptable which I didn’t have.  The unhelpful staff and then the manager offered no solution and just shrugged and said “nothing we can do”.  It should again be noted that my photo ID was acceptable before but not now – it should also be noted that the confirmation email only requested “photo ID” which I provided. No specific ID was asked for.  So it seems this hotel makes up the terms and condition s as they go and seemingly change them when they feel like it! The room had been paid for so there was no chance of my running off without paying.  After some time I finally resolved this by my husband racing home and emailing a copy of the passport which was grudgingly accepted otherwise my I was looking at nowhere to stay after an early, start at 4 a.m., a very long day then finally the hopeless staff at this place refusing entry to a customer who had paid way in advance causing a lot of stress!  The receptionist told me they needed the passport to verify the address – however my address is not in the passport so this is a bit confusing. The manager confirmed this as well as confirming no entry and no help.  This is really terrible service as they could have easily verified the address with other documents I  had but this was not accepted – my  ID clearly showed me  as senior management at a local large organisation but the staff were unhelpful and seemed totally disinterested that I would have nowhere to stay – this part of London gets booked quickly hence my booking way in advance so the likelihood of getting a room somewhere else was very remote. It would have been simple to verify me but the staff were more interested in being difficult.  So my feeling is the staff had maybe screwed up with another customer and had decided to ad hoc changes to the terms leaving me almost stranded. It could also have been a method of releasing a room for someone else – maybe a friend of the hotel. Who knows but I would be very careful using this place as they seem to have some very dubious and “flexible” terms for staying here and you may get caught out.  I will never book here again and as a vice president of a large global organisation that hosts many international clients, I would certainly not recommend this place. It's short sighted of this hotel to be so unhelpful as they will have lost business but their lack of help displays a clear lack of interest in the customer.   Please book here if you are happy to risk sleeping on the park bench instead of a hotel room!  No doubt the hotel will quote they have to have the passport but given it was not required a few weeks before and is not requested on the booking confirmation then decide for yourself.

As we arrived rather early, Nikki helped us to secure a room earlier than official check in time, so that we can put our luggages and rest.\nThe concierge guys were great, giving advice on how best to get to our destination. The Chinese gentleman, sorry, I didn't get his name, even helped me with my Bolt app bookings!\nWe booked 2 new twin rooms. Although they were small, they were sufficient for 2 pax in each room.

Simple, classy, hub hotel room.   Amazing central London location. Steps away from tube station, we visited tourist sites in the area.  Great for our city weekend break.   The beds are superbly comfortable.  I travelled solo ALOT for work, so I know what I like or not about hotel rooms. On this occasion I was traveling with my 3 kids, and the absence of TV meant they slept undistracted. The absence of carpeted floors, decorative pillows and bed runners, (that I suspect are rarely washed in other hotels) was perfect, as it means I didn't have to make sure my kids weren't touching any unclean fabric items.  We were out for majority of our stay. So the lack of view/windows, wasn't any concern. No breakfast option, but we grabbed fruit for breakfast from Tesco express nearby. There is a 24hour cafe \u0026 bar next door, that is good option too.  If you know what you're booking and what to expect, you won't be claustrophobic, instead you'll be pleasantly surprised.  Reception team member is my reason for leaving a review though - he comp'd our left luggage :)  I hope if Zedwell family see this they compliment his action, because he's gained you return custom and extra revenue, as I'll now book again due to how thoughtful and personable his service was towards my family, thank you. I've misplaced where I noted his name, Sherif(?) [Tall, young, South Asian origin].

Two single ”metal framed” beds with one pillow on one bed and two on the other, for some odd reason. Seemingly clean but very minimal. The window is a fire hazard... the outer (original) windows do not close and the inner windows do not open (due to the curtain rail impeding it).  The place was tired and had peeling and cracked ceilings.  The bathroom was a small all in one ”unit” as in an RV... all plastic... so compact that when you sat on the toilet your face barely missed the small sink... the shower unit directly in front.  There was a short pull switch for the lighting in the bathroom and there were cigarette burns on the sink on the ledge behind the toilet.  The TV was minute (about the size of a laptop) but we could not even switch it on... no remote and could not find a switch on the unit.  No amenities whatsoever.. a towel with a sachet of soap.... no kettle or anything else.  Linoleum floors and a small desk which was chipped and scratched.   The toilet in the hallway reeked of urine.  We told the reception we felt the room and the TV were tiny... not what we expected for the money.  That was when we first arrived.  We were staying for one night and decided to grin and bear it... after we returned much later.. after dinner and theatre.... we realised just how bad it was... but we were pretty stuck.  The tiny table fan they gave after we requested it... was so cheap it fell apart as we handed it back as we left.  All in all the worst hotel I have ever stayed in... I would only recommend people NOT stay there.

Not a big problem considering the cost saved but would have been good if the hotel offered a fuss free option for business travelers (wouldn't have minded paying more to be honest)  Room service: had to order and make payment through the app too, unlike other hotels that you just order and settle on checkout. everything seemed a bit ”self-service” and not as convenient as i had hoped for Breakfast: Manager refused to provide a take away cup/box and let me grab a coffee/ croissant to go.

This stately looking luxury hotel is physically located in the heart of London within close proximity to all the wonderful ”must see” attractions. The neighborhood appeared very safe, close to public transportation and if desired, very easy to find taxi service. Staying at this fine hotel allowed us to experience a ”royal stay” from the moment we arrived and were warmly greeted at the front door.  Customer service is an obvious priority as set forth from the front desk to their cleaning crew. Their attention to detail rates 5 stars in every way imaginable in my opinion. The entire hotel is immaculate, the staff is professionally trained, extremely pleasant and very efficient.

The reception area is very lovely and our room was spacious. The location was literally across the street from Victoria station so we were able to get all around London quickly. The included buffet breakfast was wonderful. It reminded us more of a Riu resort breakfast rather than an included hotel breakfast. The shower was nice and large, and the bed was very comfortable. We were disappointed with a few things. First, the elevator at the back of the hotel near the breakfast area was impossible to get. We ended up using the stairs each morning. It was easy going down, but harder going back up. Next, the lights in our hallway didn't come on right away so it was very dark. I didn't feel safe walking in the dark. The floors in the hallway were some sort of vinyl. It felt like we were in a hospital corridor, very sterile. The rooms also had no carpet. I had specifically booked a room with a window as we wanted a view of London. What we got was a view of the rooms backing up to our room. I was so upset that we paid more for nothing. We should have paid less for a window-less room because there was absolutely nothing to see. The window was the biggest insult, but other than that we were overall pleased with our stay.","rating":4,"avatarImgUrl":"","reviewDate":"2023-11-08 17:11:39"},"stimulation":{"lastBookTime":{"value":23,"unit":"Hour"}},"encourage":{"breakfast":true,"cancellation":false},"displayPrice":{"price":130,"taxPrice":156,"oriPrice":0,"checkIn":"2024-08-12"},"openYear":"2023-07-28","fitmentYear":"1753-01-01","zoneName":"Westminster, London","distanceTxt":"1.91km"},{"hotelId":2086689,"hotelUrl":"park-plaza-victoria-london","hotelJumpUrl":"https://uk.trip.com/hotels/london-hotel-detail-2086689/park-plaza-victoria-london/","hotelMetaJumpUrl":"https://uk.trip.com/hotels/list/searchresults?city=null\u0026hotelid=2086689","hotelName":"Park Plaza Victoria London","districtName":"Westminster","districtId":685427,"districtJumpUrl":"/hotels/list?city=338\u0026optionType=Zone\u0026optionId=685427","lat":51.494317,"lon":-0.14132,"brief":"Park Plaza Victoria London is in the heart of London, within a 5-minute walk of Apollo Victoria Theatre and Victoria Palace Theatre.

I was being charged with a discussionary charge of the tips on the credit card  automatically without being informed upfront after I checked out and left the hotel. \nWhen I checked out, i was informed at the counter that they were closing their account for previous day and they would help me check out my room and email me the invoice of my stay after they finished closing account. As a result, I innocently left the hotel since I thought a 5-star hotel would not have anything gone wrong. However, I was totally wrong until I saw extra charges on my credit card while not receiving any so called invoice from the hotel at all. I then reached out to Trip.com to request for the invoice that they have promised to send to me and it was then I was informed that the extra charges were from a discussionary charge of tips. I wasn’t happy about the way this was done hence I requested for a refund for this since it clearly stated this is a DISCUSSIONARY fee, not a compulsory fee. However, I was informed that this is a Non-refundable fee and my request was denied.\n\nOut of so many hotels I have stayed, it is unbelievable that in a 5-Star hotel, I was forced to pay something that wasn’t even being informed upfront. In addition, with the fee name suggested, it is a discussionary charge of tips NOT a compulsory charge of tips, the hotel has forced the customers to pay it as COMPULSORY CHARGE OF TIPS.\n\nIn addition, the hotel services were very inefficient and lot of rooms for improve. We ordered for an in-room meal and we were told that it would take about half an hour to deliver. Hence we waited, and until an hour later, there was no update on our meal and we had to make a call again to check for the progress of our meal. It was then we knew there was a delay in the meal. By the time we done with our meal, we made the call again to request for someone to collect the plates, we literally waited for more than an hour and had to call twice before someone came to pick up the plates.\n\nThis shouldn’t have been the service received in a 5-star hotel and the worst of all, the hotel should have more transparency in their charges and should have informed the customers on the charges upfront before the actual charging. When we signed for the amount paid for the meal, there were no statement on the discussionary charge of tips at all, and we didn’t expect there would be as we were not even informed. \nIt is not that we are unwilling to give the tips and we did give the tips during the stay. However, it made us very uncomfortable that we weren’t informed anything upfront and it was charged to my credit card AFTER we CHECKED OUT of THE HOTEL. It made us feeling very unsafe to provide the credit card to the hotel as they can charge whatever charges they want after checking out the hotel. In addition, it is a discussionary charge, isn’t it should be discussed before I was being charged? If not it should be called a a compulsory charge of tips.","rating":3.7,"avatarImgUrl":"https://ak-d.tripcdn.com/target/1i50h12000dex2cnoF179.jpg","reviewDate":"2022-11-12 23:45:00"},"stimulation":{"lastBookTime":{"value":0,"unit":"Hour"}},"encourage":{"breakfast":true,"cancellation":false},"displayPrice":{"price":352,"taxPrice":422,"oriPrice":0,"checkIn":"2024-08-14"},"hotelFeatureTagInfo":[],"openYear":"1967-01-01","fitmentYear":"1753-01-01","zoneName":"Westminster, London","poiUrl":"/hotels/list?city=338","nicknameFirstLetter":"G"},{"hotelId":2147416,"hotelUrl":"holiday-inn-london-sutton","hotelJumpUrl":"https://uk.trip.com/hotels/sutton-hotel-detail-2147416/holiday-inn-london-sutton/","hotelMetaJumpUrl":"https://uk.trip.com/hotels/list/searchresults?city=338\u0026hotelid=2147416","hotelName":"Holiday Inn London - Sutton","districtId":0,"hotelNameUrl":"https://uk.trip.com/hotels/sutton-hotel-detail-2147416/holiday-inn-london-sutton/","lat":51.361713,"lon":-0.196645,"brief":"A stylish Sutton hotel with a welcoming Open Lobby, serving food all through the day, with a relaxing indoor pool and sauna.Holiday Inn® London - Sutton hotel places you a short walk from Sutton train station and steps from town centre shops and restaurants.At nearby Sutton station, fast trains to London Victoria take half an hour.

Overall a great place to stay.","rating":5,"avatarImgUrl":"","reviewDate":"2022-09-09 06:16:52"},"stimulation":{"lastBookTime":{"value":0,"unit":"Hour"}},"encourage":{"breakfast":true,"cancellation":false},"displayPrice":{"price":97,"taxPrice":117,"oriPrice":0,"checkIn":"2024-08-12"},"hotelFeatureTagInfo":[],"openYear":"2017-01-01","fitmentYear":"2017-01-01","zoneName":"Tower Hamlets, London","poiUrl":"/hotels/list?city=338","nicknameFirstLetter":"G"},{"hotelId":717994,"hotelUrl":"the-chelsea-harbour-hotel-london","hotelJumpUrl":"https://uk.trip.com/hotels/london-hotel-detail-717994/the-chelsea-harbour-hotel-london/","hotelMetaJumpUrl":"https://uk.trip.com/hotels/list/searchresults?city=338\u0026hotelid=717994","hotelName":"The Chelsea Harbour Hotel and Spa","districtName":"Hammersmith and Fulham","districtId":685425,"districtJumpUrl":"/hotels/list?city=338\u0026optionType=Zone\u0026optionId=685425","hotelNameUrl":"https://uk.trip.com/hotels/london-hotel-detail-717994/the-chelsea-harbour-hotel-london/","lat":51.4759894,"lon":-0.1819745,"brief":"Located in London (Hammersmith and Fulham), The Chelsea Harbour Hotel and Spa is within a 10-minute drive of Hyde Park and Buckingham Palace.

Tarek at the front desk deserves a raise! I communicated with him through the phone as we were arriving super early and his honesty of possibly having a room ready helped us Taylor the beginning of our trip. We were able to check in early with him and we received a following up call from Tarek 5mn after entering the room,  as he wanted to make sure we were happy with our room and that he was there if we needed him. Even during a very busy period he made the time to sort through all our requests. Such service makes the difference and that convinced us to come back in the future.   The views from the higher floors are amazing. The room was clean and the perfect size for our 5 night stay.  The bar/restaurant always had a great vibe both a breakfast and dinner; the serving sizes were large and we were very pleased. The lobby area is very well done and smells really nice!  Only little downside was there was no business center and we needed to print some stuff . However, Tarek offered immediately to print our documents.

My wife and I stayed here twice, for 3 and 4 days respectively while touring the UK. The rooms were comfortable for sleeping, quiet and the air-conditioning worked well. The bathrooms were well designed and very clean. Housekeeping was fine. The major problem was that both of our rooms were very small and they had virtually no space for clothing. There was no usable drawer space and closets were tiny and had an inadequate number of hangers as well. If you are traveling for other than 1-2 days, there is no place to put anything. Living out of suitcases for 4 days or more does not add to the enjoyment of one's trip. The Breakfast is at best, just OK. There is a minimal amount of fresh fruit and while you can order off a hot  breakfast menu, most things we ordered were not very good, so we stopped doing that. The Reception staff was marginally helpful. No one came to help us with our luggage. If you need a taxi or limo to take you to the airport, you are on your own. In addition, the front of the hotel is covered by bus stops so the taxi or limo has to try to find a place to pull us to load or unload. There are just a lot of annoying things about this hotel, some could be remedied, others probably not.

Simple, classy, hub hotel room.   Amazing central London location. Steps away from tube station, we visited tourist sites in the area.  Great for our city weekend break.   The beds are superbly comfortable.  I travelled solo ALOT for work, so I know what I like or not about hotel rooms. On this occasion I was traveling with my 3 kids, and the absence of TV meant they slept undistracted. The absence of carpeted floors, decorative pillows and bed runners, (that I suspect are rarely washed in other hotels) was perfect, as it means I didn't have to make sure my kids weren't touching any unclean fabric items.  We were out for majority of our stay. So the lack of view/windows, wasn't any concern. No breakfast option, but we grabbed fruit for breakfast from Tesco express nearby. There is a 24hour cafe \u0026 bar next door, that is good option too.  If you know what you're booking and what to expect, you won't be claustrophobic, instead you'll be pleasantly surprised.  Reception team member is my reason for leaving a review though - he comp'd our left luggage :)  I hope if Zedwell family see this they compliment his action, because he's gained you return custom and extra revenue, as I'll now book again due to how thoughtful and personable his service was towards my family, thank you.
